# SPICLUM

System Prevalence In Common Lisp Using MOP, pronounced however spiculum's pronounced. In case you'd like to disregard the collective wisdom of roughly sixty years of database usage, and instead keep an object store in memory, serialize to and from text files, and rely on as much automagic as possible.

### Example

...

### Portability

The following implementations are supported:

* SBCL 2.0.2+

There are three places where reader conditionals appear, though. So the amount of work to port SPICLUM to other implementations is presumably low. But it's a presumption.

### Design

...

### Installation

From source. E.g. clone the repo and place the folder in your local quicklisp search path.

### License
